Development primarily consists of two methods. They are issues and pull requests. As a general rule of thumb, issues reveal parts of the code that need to be upgraded, and pull requests submit changes. New scripts can request to be added by creating a pull request with that code included. Issues can be created, then the changes submitted through a pull request. Be sure to mention in your pull request which issue it resolves with #\<issue number\>.
  
Happy coding!
